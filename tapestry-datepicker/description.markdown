# Alternative Tapestry Datepicker


The alternative datepicker works by adding a date translator to any textfield with a type of date/calendar/timestamp. This restricts the input to a valid date. The other piece is a mixin that provides the client side datapicker. Currently the JQuery datepicker is supported. Datepicker options are provided by data- attributes. Keep in mind data- attributes are converted to lower case but data-day-name-short maps to the dayNamesShort option.
